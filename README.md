# HealthCare app
### This app is related to Health and Medical Services

## About Project 
### 1 | I use context Api for this project
### 2 | I add two PrivateRoute for this project . One is for Services and Another is Appointment for Doctor.
### 3 | If user redirect to LogIn page and after LogIn complite the user go back to his previous Route where the user wanted to go without logIn
### 4 | After logIn complite you can see the user information on the Header.
### 5 | If you give a rendom email if will logIn to website but you can't see the user Name on the Header section.
### 6 | I use React-Hook-Form for form validation.


## What's the Drawback 
### Can't fix the reload issue Redirect when user is Already LogIn
